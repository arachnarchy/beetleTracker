Video tracking program used in [Static antennae act as locomotory guides that compensate for visual motion blur in a diurnal, keen-eyed predator. Zurek and Gilbert (2014) Proc Roy Soc B](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1779/20133072). Loads high speed video files containing top-down and lateral views of tiger beetles running over different height and contrast obstacles. Script tracks the subject and calculates telemetry data such as pitch angle, velocity, etc. Contains several error detection routines and outputs verification plots to double-check tracking accuracy.
